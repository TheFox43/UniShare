                Hi! I'm a regular italian guy, class '98, and no, I do not throw random hand gestures up in the air while I'm speaking. I love whatever has ome complexity in itself, like coding, Math, Physics, videomaking and so on. You can find my coding projects in my <a href="https://github.com/TheFox43/" target="_blank" title="GitHub">GitHub profile</a>! But what about my other passions? Well, I started studying Physics at the University of Ferrara back in 2017, that's a long one as you see. I made some videos here and there on Youtube and Instagram though. But now I'm back on track! I'm coming back to University in September 2025, let's see how does it wrap up.
